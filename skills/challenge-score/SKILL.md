description: Use for scoring current submission and inspecting score-related endpoints.

# Purpose

This skill provides a reliable way to score the current FlowRadar submission and quickly inspect score-related outputs.

# Quick Start

From challenge root:

```bash
python3 skills/challenge-score/scripts/check_score.py
```

What it does:
1. Loads `FLR_CHALLENGE_API_KEY` from root `.env` (if present).
2. Reads submission file from `src/flr_challenge/challenge/flowradar/src/submissions.py`.
3. Sends `POST http://localhost:10001/score` with `X-API-Key` header.
4. Prints score output (F1 score expected from `0` to `1`).

# Important Files

- `skills/challenge-score/scripts/check_score.py` - local scoring helper script.
- `src/flr_challenge/challenge/api/endpoints/challenge/schemas.py` - `MinerOutput` and score telemetry schema.
- `src/flr_challenge/challenge/api/endpoints/challenge/router.py` - challenge endpoint definitions.
- `src/flr_challenge/challenge/flowradar/src/submissions.py` - current solver submission.

# Scoring System

The script builds payload using the challenge submission format:

```json
{
  "miner_input": {
    "random_val": "<random string>"
  },
  "miner_output": {
    "commit_files": "<contents of submissions.py>"
  }
}
```

`MinerOutput` constraints (from schema):
- `commit_files` is required.
- content should be valid Python.
- content must respect configured submission line limit.

Expected `/score` behavior:
- endpoint scores provided `miner_output` by replaying dataset rows.
- response is a score float in `[0, 1]`.

# Do / Don't

Do:
- keep solver logic in `src/flr_challenge/challenge/flowradar/src/submissions.py`.
- score after every meaningful submission change.
- inspect telemetry/results when score changes unexpectedly.

Don't:
- send empty or partial `commit_files` content.
- move submission logic outside `submissions.py` without updating challenge config.
- assume stale score state; rerun scoring after edits.

# Helper Scripts

- `python3 skills/challenge-score/scripts/check_score.py`
  - reads `submissions.py`
  - calls `/score`
  - prints score or raw error response

# Verification Steps

1. Ensure API server is running on `localhost:10001`.
2. Ensure root `.env` has `FLR_CHALLENGE_API_KEY`.
3. Run script and confirm numeric output between `0` and `1`.
4. Optional: inspect `GET /telemetry` and `GET /results` for deeper validation.

# Troubleshooting

- Missing file error:
  - confirm `src/flr_challenge/challenge/flowradar/src/submissions.py` exists.
- Auth failure:
  - confirm `FLR_CHALLENGE_API_KEY` value in root `.env`.
- Validation error:
  - compare payload to `MinerOutput` in `src/flr_challenge/challenge/api/endpoints/challenge/schemas.py`.
- Connection error:
  - verify local API is reachable at `http://localhost:10001`.
- Need detailed scoring breakdown:
  - inspect Docker container logs for challenge API/scorer service; logs include request errors and F1 details.

# Related Endpoints

From `src/flr_challenge/challenge/api/endpoints/challenge/router.py`:

- `GET /task` - returns current miner input (randomized string).
- `POST /score` - scores submission payload.
- `GET /status` - current scoring status.
- `GET /results` - stored prediction results.
- `GET /telemetry` - latest scoring telemetry (`request_id`, runtime, network bytes, score).

# Expected Success States

- scoring script exits with code `0`.
- output is a float score in `[0, 1]`.
- telemetry endpoint shows latest run metrics with a populated `score`.
